I am currently developing a volleyball sideline statistic tracking app using React, React Native, Bootstrap, .NET and MS SQL to be used by varsity teams and coaching staff.  I will be developing two interfaces; one developed for Android and iOS devices using React Native and the other being web based for desktop computers. Both interfaces will connect to a MS SQL server to keep data persistent from match to match.
